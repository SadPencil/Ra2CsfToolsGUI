# Ra2CsfToolsGUI

## Introduction

This is a tool helping users process with string table files (.csf) that is recognized by Red Alert 2 and Yuri's Revenge. It enables you to:
- Edit the .csf file with your favorite text editor, by converting the .csf file to .ini file, and then back to .csf file.
- No need to preserve the .csf file. Only store the .ini file in your Git repository as it contains everything needed to generate a .csf file.
- Tile the translated file with the upstream file, so you may finish the translation without searching for the needle between two files.
- Highlight the translation update between old version and new versions for your old-version translation, so you may update the translation effectively.
